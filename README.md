# Unexpected Error Accessing Columns in Nested Data Frames in R

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle error in R when working with lists of data frames. The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to create a list of data frames, but the access method to the columns of the data frames within the list is flawed.  The `bugSolution.r` file provides the corrected version.

This is a great example of a common issue encountered by R users and highlights the importance of understanding list structure and proper element access techniques.
